## RASA powered chatbot which helps people to get state-wise COVID-19 details in India

### Telegram Integration has been setup by me. 

### Go to telegram and search for BotFather which will help you create your own chatbot. Get the access_token from your new created bot and fill it in the credentials.yml file

### Then use ngrok and get your public url and fill it in the credentials.yml file along with access_token and verify your bot name

### Then just run the commands 'rasa run actions' and 'rasa run'

### Now just open telegram app or web and chat with your COVID-19 tracker bot. Happy Chatting!!
